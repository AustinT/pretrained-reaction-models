Code for the retro-star model.

Code extracted from [here](https://github.com/binghong-ml/retro_star/tree/master/retro_star/packages/mlp_retrosyn/mlp_retrosyn),
with minimal changes to formatting.

To install, run `download_files.sh` from this directory which downloads the files and runs a script to canonicalize the SMILES
in the `origin_dict`.
